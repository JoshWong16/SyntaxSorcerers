# UBC Course Connect
## CPEN 321 Project – SyntaxSorcerers

UBC Course Connect is a mobile app where students are able to compare historical UBC grade data, post on a course forum with their questions, and get UBC courses recommended to them. This eliminates the need to open multiple tabs on your computer when planning courses at UBC.

Our mobile application allows students to search for specific UBC course sections through dropdown menus and displays the data and graphs corresponding to the course’s data. Students can search for two courses simultaneously to directly compare the course data on the same screen. As students search for course data, they can “favourite” courses to save on their profile so they can easily reference and view courses they viewed in the past. Additionally, students have access to course-specific forums where they can discuss course details with other students through forum posts and comments. The last main feature of our app is to recommend courses to students based on their information.
